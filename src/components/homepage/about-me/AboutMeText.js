          Hi! My name is Mark Li. I'm a recent graduate from{" "}
          <span className="text-purple-700">Northwestern University</span> with
          a BS/MS in Computer Science and a BA in Music.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm interested in sustainable computing, web design, and embedded
          systems, but I'm always willing to learn something new. Outside of
          programming, I enjoy making music, playing ultimate frisbee, and
          trying new foods.
        </p>
