        If you're reading this then it probably means you think my projects
        are cool :D (or at least I hope so) but I think I'm going to just be
        putting projects that I've worked on along with a little description.
        There are lots of things I want to create and I'll list them down
        below. It's likely that I've already started and just haven't
        completed them so come back another time and maybe this list will
        expand.

        I don't exactly know what I want to do with this website, but it is
        really fun to add to and work on. I think I'm likely to just end up
        putting any cool projects or I thought were interesting (or more
        likely the ones that took the most work).
      </P>

        I'm also hoping to add more sections to this website such as a blog or
        resume page. I'd like to be able to include more about myself and my
        work on this website. I'll also probably update the design relatively
        often as I make graphic design more my passion and as I get sick of
        how it currently looks.
