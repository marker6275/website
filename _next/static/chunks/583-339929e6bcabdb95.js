The feedback was positive, and everything seemed to make sense and run smoothly. Students were able to understand the concepts and apply them to the activity. Students were also able to create circuits according to the instructions and understand the tradeoffs of different materials. I would love to run the workshop for real some day. I think this would be a great way to introduce sustainability to engineering students, so I would love to see this truly taught in a college setting."})]})},{})},b,p,j,x,w,m],v=[["text-[#1C49FF]","hover:bg-[#E3E8FF]","hover:border-[#1C49FF]"],["text-[#1C55E0]","hover:bg-[#E3EAFB]","hover:border-[#1C55E0]"],["text-[#1C61C1]","hover:bg-[#E3ECF7]","hover:border-[#1C61C1]"],["text-[#1C6DA2]","hover:bg-[#E3EEF3]","hover:border-[#1C6DA2]"],["text-[#1C7983]","hover:bg-[#E3F0EF]","hover:border-[#1C7983]"],["text-[#1C8564]","hover:bg-[#E3F2EB]","hover:border-[#1C8564]"],["text-[#1C9145]","hover:bg-[#E3F4E7]","hover:border-[#1C9145]"],["text-[#1C9D26]","hover:bg-[#E3F6E3]","hover:border-[#1C9D26]"],["text-[#1CA907]","hover:bg-[#E3F8DF]","hover:border-[#1CA907]"]],k=["January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"]},6928:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{ProjectCard:()=>o});var i=s(5155),n=s(2115),r=s(5159);function o(e){let{name:t,color:s,description:o,image:a,children:l,link:h}=e,[c,d]=(0,n.useState)(!1),u=()=>{d(!c)};return(0,n.useEffect)(()=>{c||(window.onscroll=function(){})},[c]),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative w-full",children:[(0,i.jsxs)("div",{onClick:()=>{h?window.open(h,"_blank"):c||u()},className:"cursor-pointer border-4 ".concat(s," bg-gray-300/10 p-5 lg:p-8 pb-6 lg:w-[36vw] h-52 flex rounded-xl shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-all duration-300 hover:cursor hover:-translate-y-1 gap-2 hover:border-b-5 overflow-hidden"),children:[(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-3 md:gap-5 w-3/4 justify-between",children:[(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"text-3xl xl:text-4xl",children:t}),o&&(0,i.jsxs)("p",{className:"text-sm md:text-base xl:text-lg line-clamp-2 overflow-visible",children:["Description:",(0,i.jsxs)("span",{className:"text-sm md:text-base xl:text-lg font-light",children:[" ",o]})]})]}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"absolute right-5 top-5 xl:relative xl:flex xl:top-0 xl:items-center overflow-visible",children:a&&(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:a,alt:a,className:"size-16 xl:size-32 rounded-full object-contain"})})]}),(0,i.jsx)(r.a,{show:c,onClose:u,children:l})]})}},8446:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{HomeProjectCard:()=>o});var i=s(5155),n=s(2115),r=s(5159);function o(e){let{name:t,text:s,children:o,link:a}=e,[l,h]=(0,n.useState)(!1),c=()=>{h(!l)};return(0,n.useEffect)(()=>{l||(window.onscroll=function(){})},[l]),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,i.jsx)("div",{onClick:()=>{a?window.open(a,"_blank"):l||setTimeout(()=>{c()},100)},className:"border-2 border-black bg-gray-300/10 font-extralight h-24 lg:h-32 rounded-lg flex items-center text-3xl hover:cursor-pointer ".concat(s," transition-all duration-300 p-10 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-md hover:border-b-3 flex justify-center"),children:t}),(0,i.jsx)(r.a,{show:l,onClose:c,children:o})]})}}}]);
